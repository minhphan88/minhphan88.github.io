## About the project
  This is the second phase of the Predicting Revenue-Related Metrics using Google ads data, to check phase one please follow this [link](/processing/python).
### Goal
 The project was designed to test different regressors in order to predict the revenue-related metric*, using Rooted Mean Squared Error(RMSR).
### Data
  This dataset contains online advertising data where the target feature is a revenue-related metric and the descriptive features are various advertising metrics and characteristics.
  The details of how this metric was created or what it measures was not given by the clients.
### Outcomes
  Overall, most of models have the RMSE is around 1(0.9) dollar.
### Limitations
  The project does have its a few flaws and limitations (details in the report)

The project demonstrates the ability to work with Python libraries include *Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Sklearn(KNN, Decision Tree and other regressors)*

## What  I've learned from this projects
  1. Overfitting
  2. Data preparations
  3. Expert knowledge
