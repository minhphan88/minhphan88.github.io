  I am a data scientist who wants to improve business decision-making process through the use of considered data analysis. I believe that communication is key to the process and storytelling is the most straightforward way to inform both decision-makers and the public.


  I thrive in a fast-moving changing environment. I celebrate when presented with new challenges. In addition, I love engaging people at all levels with the enthusiasm for learning and making positive change.
