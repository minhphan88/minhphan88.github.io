**Abstract:** Cell polarization requires redistribution of specific proteins to
the nascent front and back of a eukarytotic cell. Among these proteins are Rac
and Rho, members of the small GTPase family that regulate the actin
cytoskeleton. Rac promotes actin assembly and protrusion of the front edge,
whereas Rho activates myosin-driven contraction at the back. Mathematical
models of cell polarization at many levels of detail have appeared. One of
the simplest based on" wave-pinning", consists of a pair of
reaction-diffusion equations for a single GTPase. Mathematical analysis of
wave-pinning so far is largely restricted to static domains in one spatial
dimension. Here we extend the analysis to cells that change in size, showing
that both shrinking and growing cells can lose polarity. We further consider
the feedback between mechanical tension, GTPase activation, and cell
deformation in both static, growing, shrinking, and moving cells. Special
cases (spatially uniform cell chemistry, absence or presence of mechanical
feedback) are analyzed, and the full model is explored by simulations
in 1D. We find a variety of novel behaviors, including" dilution-induced"
oscillations of Rac activity and cell size, as well as gain or loss of
polarization and motility in the model cell.
