**Abstract:** In 2006 Armstrong, Painter and Sherratt formulated a non-local 
differential equation model for cell-cell adhesion. For the one dimensional case 
we derive various types of adhesive, repulsive, and no-flux boundary bonditions. 
We prove local and global existence and uniqueness for the resulting 
integro-differential equations. In numerical simulations we consider adhesive, 
repulsive and neutral boundary conditions and we show that the solutions mimic 
known behavior of fluid adhesion to boundaries. In addition, we observe interior 
pattern formation due to cell-cell adhesion.
