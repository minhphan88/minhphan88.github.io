## About the project
  The objective of this project is to predict the revenue-related metric using the dataset provided by a client, an ad agency. This project has two phases. Phase I focuses on data preprocessing and exploration, as covered in this report. We shall present model building in Phase II [(link)](/machinelearning/machinelearning-google).

  The project is an example of data preprocessing in Python.

## Goal
  This project aims to prepare the data for the modelling process. The project includes three sections:
  1. Describing the dataset and its attributes.
  2. Data pre-processing
  3. Exploring each attribute and their inter-relationships.

## Data
  This dataset contains online advertising data where the target feature is a revenue-related metric and the descriptive features are various advertising metrics and characteristics.

## Outcomes
  The project provided an overall understanding of the dataset and its attributes via visualisations. In addition, the dataset was prepared appropriately for the modelling phase.

## Limitations
  The project can benefits from  marketing expert knowledge regarding some of the attributes such as ratio1, ratio2, ratio3, etc.

## What I've learned from this project
  1. The process

    The data pre-process is not linear; each of the steps of the process has be revisited multiple times during the project.
  2. Expert knowledge matters

    The project presented myself with an exciting learning opportunity; I have learned so much more about Google ads. However, expert knowledge will add more layers the understanding of the dataset.

The projects covers various steps of the data preprocessing including:

  1. Dealing with continuous and categorical data.
  2. Data normalisation.
  3. Dealing with missing values.
  4. Data exploration using univariate and multivariate visualisation.
  5. Creating new variables.

The project demonstrates the ability to work with Python libraries including *Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and SciPy*
