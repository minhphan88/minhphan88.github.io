## About the project
  The project is an extension of the [Melbourne property story](/presentations/property).

## Goal
  The project aims to create an interactive dashboard for the audience of [Melbourne property story](/presentations/property). The dashboard offers the opportunity to investigate the suburbs' growths in details.

## Data
  The project used public data from Domain Media (texts), State Government of Victoria (property price report)

## Methodology
  The dashboard was created using R shinyapps and supportive libraries.

## Outcomes

  The dashboard allow users to find which suburb that would like to buy based on the livability ranking, median price and distance the the Central Business District. In this example we chose MENZIES CREEK.
  ![choose a suburb](/assets/choose_suburb.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

  Then they can investigate the growth of MENZIES CREEK.
  ![compare with other suburbs](/assets/growth.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
  In addition, the dashboard also provide the opportunity to compare this growth with the general trend,
  ![compare with other suburbs](/assets/suburb_2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
  or with other suburb.
  ![compare with other suburbs](/assets/suburb_1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}



  You can [interact with the dashboard](https://mqphan143.shinyapps.io/AssigmentFinal/) here.



## What I've learned from this project
  1. People love to play:

      Interactive visualisation appeals to our curious nature and desire to play [(Murray 2013, page 26-27)][https://www.imel.ba/edukacija/interactivedatavisualizationfortheweb.pdf].

  2. Minimal viable analysis:

      A. Create a usable analysis [Melbourne property story visualisation](https://rpubs.com/minhphan/dataviz2).

      B. Then present the insights with the audience, collect feedbacks.

      C. Improve the analysis with more features based on the feedbacks [the dashboard](https://mqphan143.shinyapps.io/AssigmentFinal/).

      D. Collect more feedbacks and the cycle continues.











The project demonstrates the ability to work tools including
  1. A complete MapReduce implementation in Java with some components of Natural Language Processing.
  2. Amazon EMR Management.
  3. *Amazon S3 bucket, Eclipse,Apache Hadoop, Maven*.
