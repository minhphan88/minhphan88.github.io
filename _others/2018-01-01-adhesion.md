When cells in a tissue exert traction forces, they pull on one another and on
the underlying matrix, much like a tug of war. The side that exerts the largest
force ``wins'' and determines the direction of cell movement.  Interestingly,
such effects operate over long distances (nonlocal), not simply by
neighbour-to-neighbour (local) contact. But most traditional continuum models
(PDEs) can only describe local interactions. Hence, the novelty of
integro-PDEs (iPDEs), namely their integral terms, is that they capture the
nonlocal mechanical stresses in a tissue, and are a much more accurate
description. The scalar non-local adhesion model is written as:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( u(x,t) \int_{-R}^{R} h(u(x+r,t))\Omega(r)\, \mathrm{d} r \right),$$

where $u(x,t)$ is the density of a cell population, $R$ the sensing radius of a
cell, $d$ the diffusion constant, $\alpha$ the strength of homotypic adhesion
between members of population $u(x,t)$, $\Omega(r)$ a odd function, and $h(u)$
a function modelling the adhesion bond kinetics.
