## About the project
  The project is an example of a data science story.

## Goal
 The project aims to provide useful informations for individuals who wish to find a home in one of the world most livable city- Melbourne.

 This is a first cycle of a minimal viable analysis, the feedbacks of this story will be used to create an interactive [dashboard](/others/dashboard).
## Data
  The projects combined three different datasets from Domain Media (texts), State Government of Victoria (reports) and a Kaggle competion.

## Presentation
  The project has managed to tell a story, check the video for details.

  You can [interact with the visualisation](http://rpubs.com/minhphan/dataviz2) here

## Limitations
  The project only considered a small segment of the property landscape in Melbourne- 2 bed-room units. Other types of properties such as houses and apartments can provide a very different outcome.

## What I've learned from this project:
  1. Simplicity trumps: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."  Albert Einstein
    Visualisation is created to serve the purpose communication, simplicity shows clarity in this communication.
  2. Video Editing: The project presented me with the opportunity to learn how to create and edit video. The process has deepen my appreciation of videos as a storytelling medium as well as the craft of creating them.
