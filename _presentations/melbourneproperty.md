## About the project
  The project is an example of data science storytelling.

## Goal
 The project aims to provide useful informations for individuals who wish to find a home in one of the world most livable city- Melbourne.

 This is a first cycle of a minimal viable analysis. The feedbacks of this will be used to create an interactive [dashboard](/others/dashboard).
## Data
  The projects combined three different datasets from Domain Media (texts), State Government of Victoria (reports) and a Kaggle competion.

## Presentation
  The project has managed to tell a story, check the video for details.

  You can [interact with the visualisation](http://rpubs.com/minhphan/dataviz2) here

## Limitations
  The project only considered a small segment of the property landscape in Melbourne- 2 bedroom units. Other types of properties such as houses and apartments can provide a very different outcome.

## What I've learned from this project:
  1. Simplicity trumps: Visualisation is created to serve the purpose of communication; simplicity provides clarity.
    *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." (Albert Einstein)*
  2. Video Editing: The project presented me with the opportunity to learn how to create and edit video. The process has deepened my appreciation of videos as a storytelling medium, as well as the craft of creating them.
