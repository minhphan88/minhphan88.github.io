### Limitations
  The project only considered a small segment of the property landscape in Melbourne- small units. Other types of properties such as  houses and apartments can provide a very different outcome.
### What I've learned from this project:
  1. Simplicity trumps
    "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."  Albert Einstein
    Visualisation is created to serve the purpose communication.
  2. Video Editing
    The project presented me with the opportunity to learn how to create and edit video. The process has deepen my appreciation of videos as a storytelling medium as well as the craft of creating them.
