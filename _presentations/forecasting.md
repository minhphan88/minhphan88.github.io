## The project is a presentation of evaluation and comparison the accuracy of different forecasting methods

The presentation covers three main sections:

  1. Modelling approach.
  2. Model specification.
  3. Predictions using the most appropriate model.

The project demonstrates a forecasting analysis using:
  1. Exponential smoothing methods.
  2. Linear Innovations State Space Models.
  3. Nonlinear and Heteroscedastic Innovations State Space Models
  4. Selections of model using various metrics (AIC, BIC, MASE, etc)

All of these were achieved by creating appropriate customised functions in R to analyse 1000 time series.

The project demonstrates the ability to work with R libraries include *dLagM, forecast, ggplot2, Metrics, tidyverse, TSA, x12 etc*
